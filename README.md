# z-quantum-vqe

## What is it?

`z-quantum-vqe` is a basic implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to be used with [Orquestra](https://www.zapatacomputing.com/orquestra/) â€“ a platform for performing computations on quantum computers developed by [Zapata Computing](https://www.zapatacomputing.com).

## Usage

### Workflow
In order to use `z-quantum-vqe` in your workflow, you need to add it as a resource:

```yaml
resources:
- name: z-quantum-vqe
  type: git
  parameters:
    url: "git@github.com:zapatacomputing/z-quantum-vqe.git"
    branch: "master"
```

and then import in a specific step:

```yaml
- - name: my-task
    template: template-1
    arguments:
      parameters:
      - param_1: 1
      - resources: [z-quantum-vqe]
```

Once that is done you can:
- use any template from `templates/` directory
- use tasks which import `zquantum.vqe` in the python code (see below).

### Python

Here's an example how to do use methods from `z-quantum-vqe` in a Python task:

```python
from zquantum.vqe.ansatz import build_circuit_template
ansatz = build_circuit_template(
              ansatz_type='Singlet UCCSD',
              n_mo=1,
              n_alpha=1,
              n_beta=1,
              transformation='Jordan-Wigner')
```

Even though it's intended to be used with Orquestra, you can also use it as a standalone python module.
In order to install it run `pip install .` from the `src/` directory.


## Development and contribution

You can find the development guidelines in the [`z-quantum-core` repository](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/z-quantum-core).

### Running tests

In order to run tests please run `pytest .` from the main directory.
